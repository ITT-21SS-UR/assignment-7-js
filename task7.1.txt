7.1: A short introduction to Digital Signal Processing

Question 1: What is the defining property of Gaussian noise?

Question 2: What does a low-pass filter do in general?

#Reminder: 
- Chapter 3, Section Analog Filters for Data Conversion
- block all frequencies above the cutoff frequency (the stopband)
- passing all frequencies below (the passband)

Ouestion 3: Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?

#Reminder
 - Chapter 15 Moving Average Filters, Section Frequency Response
 - low pass filter (reducing random noise while retaining a sharp step response)
 - the moving average is an exceptionally good smoothing filter (the action in the time domain), but an exceptionally bad low-pass filter (the action in the frequency domain).
