7.1: A short introduction to Digital Signal Processing

Question 1: What is the defining property of Gaussian noise?

Question 2: What does a low-pass filter do in general?

According to the book a low pass filter do in general "block all frequencies above the cutoff frequency (the stopband), while passing all frequencies below (the passband)." (chapter 3, p. 52) 

Ouestion 3: Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?

We've come to the assumption that a moving average filter is a low-pass filter. Steven W. Smith describes "the moving average is an exceptionally good smoothing filter (the action in the time domain), 
but an exceptionally bad low-pass filter (the action in the frequency domain)." (chapter 15, S. 280) 
Steven W. Smith cites the "slow roll-off and poor stopband attenuation" as reasons why the moving average is a bad low-pass filter. (chapter 15, S. 280)
