7.1: A short introduction to Digital Signal Processing

Question 1: What is the defining property of Gaussian noise?

	- Signals formed from random processes usually have a bell shaped pdf
	- The reason why this curve occurs so frequently in nature will be discussed shortly in conjunction with digital noise generation.
	- An interesting characteristic of the Gaussian is that the tails drop toward zero very rapidly, much faster than with other common functions such as decaying exponentials or 1/x.

Question 2: What does a low-pass filter do in general?

A low-pass filter is used to pass or block frequencies. When frequencies are blocked or passed by the low-pass filter depends on the cutoff frequency. 
The low-pass filter allows signals with a frequency below the cut-off frequency to pass.

According to the book a low pass filter do in general "block all frequencies above the cutoff frequency (the stopband), while passing all frequencies below (the passband)." (Smith, 1997, p. 52) 

Ouestion 3: Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?

We've come to the assumption that a moving average filter is a low-pass filter. Steven W. Smith describes "the moving average is an exceptionally good smoothing filter (the action in the time domain), 
but an exceptionally bad low-pass filter (the action in the frequency domain)" (Smith, 1997, p. 280). 
Steven W. Smith cites the "slow roll-off and poor stopband attenuation" (Smith, 1997, p. 280) as reasons 
why the moving average is a bad low-pass filter.
